Hi and welcome to the free Wordpress plugin: TE Icecast 2 Server Information

Once you've clicked install on the plugin and activated it, there will be a new widget available for you to add to your layout.
You can drag the plugin from the list into one of your page areas and adjust the settings from there.
If you have trouble with the settings not opening at first, put you wordpress admin into Accessibility Mode (see the top right of the screen) and click on Edit next
to the plugin where you can put in some values to start with and after that you should find you can edit the settings in any mode.

The settings you need to add are:

Title : What you want displayed at the top of the widget on the front end.
Server : The server URL where your stream is coming from. As standard Icecast uses port 8000 so just pop :8000 on the end of the address unless you use a custom port.
Username : Your Icecast admin username
Password : Your Icecast admin password
Show server: If ticked, this will show the server address in the frontend
Show mountpoint: If ticked, this will show the currently active mount that is streaming. Note that this will not show if it's not possible to get station information.
Mount 1 : your default mountpoint, usually /stream but it may be different in your Icecast configuration.
Mount 2 : Secondary mountpoint.
Mount 3 : Tertiary mopuntpoint.
